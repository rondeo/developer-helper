# Developer helper

Developer helper aims to be a kind of Swiss army knife for any developer.

## Why create Developer helper?

I was bored to have many little scripts that give me the length of a string,
that base64 encode or decode a string. I need a tool that do all these tasks for
me, and I don't want to look for many different websites to do it.

That's not all. I am discovering Aurelia framework and it looks great so I want
to learn it with something useful for me.

## Features

Because this project is a new born, it currently has only few features. If you
need more features please create an issue.

- String length
- Base64 encode and decode

## How to install

- Clone this repository on a HTTP server
- `npm install`

And you are done.
