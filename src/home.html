        <h1>What is this site?</h1>

        <p>
            This site is a swiss knife for a developer. As a developer I usually
            need to know the length of a string, or to base64 encode/decode a
            string, play with a timestamp, or something else.<br />
            It is tedious to switch from a website to an other each time I need
            something. That's why I build this website, in order to no longer
            waste my time.
